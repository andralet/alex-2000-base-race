Settings file ('settings.txt') have a strict format:
<Option name (look for it in 'optimization.hpp')> <Space> <Value (for boolean - 0 or 1)> <End of line>
In case of it's disturbance there can be very stange errors.
You can use a free order of options and skip them. If option is skipped the default value from 'optimization.hpp' will be used.
